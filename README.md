# React + Vite

# React E-commerce Project

Welcome to my E-Commerce store! This project showcases an e-commerce store using fakestoreapi.com using what I've learned with using react JS. Implemented responsive design simulating what a real e-commerce would utilize. 

## Features

- Will have to login or register first to access the product page or to add a product to your cart.
- Mouse hover over products to show their description including a button for adding product to the cart
- Shopping cart has a counter implemented to add the quantity of each product while making the count to 0 will delete out of the cart with also a button to just delete.
- Add a customer form and will simulate adding a customer to the fake database and will be shown with the devtools to see in state.
- Adding a new product form will also simulate adding a new product to the fake database.
- Implemented a delete button on the product page to showcase deleting an item from the product list.
